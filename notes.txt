# Current Implementation Analysis

## Backend (FastAPI)
- Has Auth0 JWT validation setup in auth.py
- Uses Auth0 domain and audience from environment variables
- Has user routes with proper authentication middleware
- User model includes auth0_user_id field

## React Webapp
- Uses @auth0/auth0-react package
- Has Auth0Provider setup with proper configuration
- Uses environment variables for Auth0 configuration
- Has useUser hook for fetching user data
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

## Expo App
- Uses Expo Router for navigation
- Has themed components (ThemedView, ThemedText)
- No current Auth0 integration
- Need to add auth0-react-native package

## Required Changes
1. Backend
   - Existing JWT validation is sufficient
   - User endpoints are properly set up

2. React Webapp
   - Needs custom login/signup UI components
   - Already has Auth0 integration
   - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

3. Expo App
   - Needs complete Auth0 integration
   - Needs custom login/signup UI components
   - Should match web styling where possible
   - Will need to use react-native-auth0 package

## Environment Variables Needed
1. Backend:
   - AUTH0_DOMAIN
   - AUTH0_AUDIENCE

2. React Webapp:
   - REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN
   - REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
   - REACT_APP_AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL
   - REACT_APP_AUTH0_AUDIENCE

3. Expo App (to be added):
   - AUTH0_DOMAIN
   - AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
